# Bouncing balls in Game Boy assembly!

A very simple demo.

Tested by me and confirmed to work on emulators (Emulicious, Mesen), Game Boy (DMG), Super Game Boy (SGB) and Game Boy Advance (AGB).

# Building

requires [RGBDS v0.7.0](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds/releases/tag/v0.7.0).
(It doesn't work properly when compiled on the latest version q-p)
